ALTERNATIVES ==>                  #  - write-file-atomic (preferred):
																	#     - most features
																	#     - sibling 'FILE.{PROCESS.pid}.{THREAD.id}.{COUNTER}'
																	#     - handles process exit
																	#  - write-json-atomic (preferred for JSON):
																	#     - based on write-file-atomic, but JSON-specific
																	#  - write-files-atomic
																	#     - can specify several files that must be atomic together as a group
																	#     - use temporary directory
																	#     - handles process exit
																	#     - not maintained
																	#  - fast-write-atomic:
																	#     - not high profile
																	#     - fastest
																	#     - sibling 'FILE.{PROCESS.pid}.{COUNTER}'
																	#  - fs-write-stream-atomic: not maintained

GOAL ==>                          #When writing a file, if write throws or if process exits, file will be partial, i.e. corrupted.
                                  #Instead write to a temporary file, then move at the end.
