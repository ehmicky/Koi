To do:
  - Upgrade to Node 11.11.0 once supported by CircleCI https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/node/tags/
  - Calendars: wait for front-end to merge, do database migration and deploy
  - x-oneOf does not work
     - in Thread.userData.lastReadMessage and User.calendar.link
     - unskip tests
  - x-dependencies does not work
     - unskip test
  - files upload in threads:
     - any file types allowed
     - both sender and receiver can upload
     - can only delete own file
     - title and description
     - security scan
     - multiple files per thread
  - OpenAPI/normalization:
     - improve validation error messages
     - replace authorization middleware
     - replace routes
     - response validation
     - enforce CRUD endpoints by passing only the model names, then core provides with routes
     - remove controllers, enforcing using always the same services methods
  - add my linter config
  - why is createUser so slow locally?
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for: filter, aggregation, pagination, sorting, population
  - check missing tests (test coverage)
  - check Stripe API doc
  - add some queries to check for data integrity (e.g. slugs are ok)
  - improve body parsing:
     - e.g. errors (payload too large) trigger 500
  - automated system that syncs staging database with production database
  - yamllint
  - upgrade helmet
  - learn latest MongoDB and upgrade it
  - improve populateMany()
  - populatedev either:
     - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach
     - generate from OpenAPI
  - analytics:
     - add more graphs to MongoDB Atlas:
        - including based on `logs` collection
        - use views for mongodb charts to allow for aggregated queries
     - see bottom of this file for more ideas
  - document sanitize-html library
  - add DNSSEC
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - add API documentation about `isAdmin` check

Analytics:
  Acquisition
    Number of new users, but abandoned (Didn't e-mail verify)
    Number of new users per day (E-mail Verified)
    Number of new phone verifications per day
    Number of first "selling" transaction per day (someone who received funds for the first time)
    Number of first "buying" transactions per day (someone who completed a transaction for the first time - not only visa confirmation, but funds transferred to someone else)
    Tracking against time (So we can understand behaviour and learn how to optimize the experience)
  Date and time user signed up (corelated with their user ID)
    Just want to make sure we can track an activity metric and also understand how long it took a user to do something. Then we can look at thinks like:
    Average time to first e-mail message
    Average time to first transaction
    Time to filling out a profile
    User demographics
  Country (presumably from web activity data, or phone verification?)
    Age, (#, and "undefined" for those who haven't shared it)
    Gender (M/F/Other and "undefined" for those who haven't shared it)
    Transactions
  Total number of transactions per day (All users)
    Total amount of $ (USD) spent by users per day
    Total amount of Income earned by users per day
    Total amount of Revenue for Prismlink per day
    Churn
  Number of users without a login/activity in 7 days
    Number of users without a login/activity in 14 days
    Number of users without a login/activity in 21 days
    Number of users without a login/activity in 28 days
    Platform activity
  Active connection categories sorted by popularity, and with average asking price
    Daily Snapshot of Total number of users "available to be contacted"
    Daily Snapshot of Total number of users "Not available to be contacted"
    Daily Snapshot of users with a profile picture loaded
    Number of platform e-mail messages sent (or received) per day
