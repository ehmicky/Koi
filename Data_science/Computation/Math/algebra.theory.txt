Expression:
  - expression: correct syntax, even if false, e.g. 1 = 0
  - statement: true expression

Variable:
  - arbitrary element of a set
  - notation:
     - single letter, often x y z ...
  - constant: when set has a single element
     - unknown constant:
        - often noted a b c ...
  - indeterminate:
     - often noted X Y Z ...
     - when:
        - cannot be known
        - no algebraic property is known
     - handled like a constant in equations
  - unknown:
     - in equations
  - degree of freedom:
     - often noted v
     - number of variables in expression
     - 0 for constant

Algebraic operations:
  - for a specific algebraic structure, all binary functions taking such structure as both input and output
  - can use constants or variables operands

Algebraic expression:
  - expression with only algebraic operations
     - i.e. generalization of algebraic operations composition

Algebraic sum:
  - algebraic expression with only addition|subtraction top-level operations
     - including none, i.e. every algebraic expression is an algebraic sum
  - term: each top-level operand
     - coefficient: parts of a term multiplying|dividing each other
        - numerical coefficient: when constant
     - number of terms:
        - 1: monomial
        - 2: binomial
        - 3: trinomial
        - 2+: multinomial

Polynomial:
  - notations: P(x,...) or P
  - when all exponents ∈ N
     - no negative exponent, i.e. no division where variable is denominator
     - no fractional exponent
  - degree:
     - of a term: sum of all exponents
        - unexponeniated variable: 1
        - constant: 0
     - of a polynomial: maximum term degree
        - 0 : constant
        - 1 : linear
        - 2 : quadratic
        - 3 : cubic
        - 4 : quartic
        - 5 : quintic
     - homogenous polynomial: when all terms have same degree
  - number of unique variables:
     - 1: univariate
     - 2: bivariate
     - 3: trivariate
     - 2+: multivariate
  - can always be expressed in canonical form: sum() aₙ * x^n
     - often written in descending degrees
  - coefficient:
     - usually means constant coefficient a canonical form
     - integer|real|complex polynomial: when coefficients ∈ N|R|C

Algebraic fraction:
  - fraction x/y where x|y are algebraic expressions
  - simple|complex fraction: whether either x|y is fraction itself
  - in lowest terms: when cannot reduce fraction, i.e. lowest common factor between x|y is 1
  - integral expression:
     - when y is omitted
     - still an algebraic fraction
        - i.e. every algebraic expression is an algebraic fraction
     - mixed expression: algebraic sum of integral expressions and non-integral expressions
  - rational [algebraic] fraction|expression:
     - when x|y are polynomials
     - proper|improper: whether degree of x < y or not
  - irrational fraction:
     - when x|y contain fractional exponents
