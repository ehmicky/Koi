Function:
  - notation:
     - f: X -> Y (whole domain)
     - f(x) = y (specific preimage)
     - F G ... (for function composition)
  - rule assigning each x (where x∈ X) to a y (where y∈ Y)
  - terms:
     - domain: X
     - codomain: Y
     - image of x: y
     - preimage of y: x
     - image of f: set of all y with a preimage
        - noted Im(f)

Function can be defined:
  - with rule:
     - algebraic, e.g. f: X -> X^2
        - can include logical conditions
  - with list of images|preimages:
     - can be:
        - numerical: as a table
        - graphical: as a graph
     - can interpolate

Domain:
  - set can be defined either:
     - with explicit elements
     - with a logical condition for any elements
        - named natural domain
  - support: subset of all x with an image != 0

Image to preimage:
  - general:
     - every preimage (x) has exactly 1 image (y)
     - some images (y) can have:
        - 0 preimages (x)
           - i.e. Im(f) ⊆ Y
        - multiple preimages (x)
  - properties:
     - injective:
        - also named one-to-one (1-1)
        - when no image (y) has multiple preimages (x)
     - surjective
        - also named onto
        - when no image (y) has 0 preimages (x)
        - i.e. Im(f) = Y
        - g: domain(f) -> Im(f) is always surjective
     - bijective:
        - injective + surjective
        - every image (y) has exactly 1 preimage (x)
        - implies |X| = |Y|
           - if |X| = |Y| and f is injective|surjective => f is surjective|injective

Function composition:
  - notation: F ∘ G
  - means f(g(x))

Functional power:
  - notation:
     - Fⁿ
     - fⁿ(x)
        - careful: is also an alternative notation for derivatives f''(x)
  - means F ∘ F ∘ ...

Inverse function:
  - noted f^-1
  - f is inverse of g if f(g(x)) = x
  - bijection:
     - non-bijective functions don't have an inverse function
     - bijective functions all have an inverse function
     - inverse functions are all bijective

Operations:
  - also named operators
  - function where preimages|images are tuples
     - noted f: X * Y * ... -> Z
        - i.e. domain is cartesian product of X * Y * ...
  - operands:
     - other name for preimages
     - also named inputs or arguments
  - outputs
     - other name for images
     - also named return values
  - arity:
     - also named rank or adicity
     - number of operands
     - names:
        - nullary|niladic: 0
        - unary|monadic: 1
        - binary|dyadic: 2
        - ternary|triadic: 3
        - quaternary|tetradic: 4
        - multary|multiary|polyadic: 2+
        - N-ary: N
        - variadic|multigrade|anadic: indefinite
  - often has own notation:
     - often uses a sign:
        - can be written:
           - infix: between operands
           - prefix|postfix: before|after operands
     - precedence:
        - also named order of operations
        - decides how to group operands and operations in infix notation
           - by assigning a higher|lower precedence to each operation

Properties:
  - unary:
     - idempotence:
        - f(x) <=> f(f(x))
  - binary:
     - commutativity: f(x,y) <=> f(y,x)
     - associativity: f(x, f(y,z)) <=> f(f(x,y), z)
  - binary returning boolean:
     - transitivity: f(x,y) && f(y,z) => f(x,z)

Representations:
  - functional diagram:
     - domain|codomain: left|right
     - images|preimages: dots
     - image|preimage relations: arrows between them
  - graph:
     - domain|codomain: abscissa|ordinate (x|y axis)
     - images|preimages: lines on abscissa|ordinate
     - image|preimage relations: dots at the intersection of images|preimages lines
        - x|y-intercept: dot where x|y is 0

Indicator function:
  - also named characteristic function, or boolean predicate function
  - f: X -> {0,1} with 1 if X∈ Y, 0 si X∉ Y

Mathematical model:
  - function used to represent a sytem (often in real life)
  - can be:
     - analytic: based on rule or logical condition
     - curve-fitting: based on list of images|preimages (regression)
