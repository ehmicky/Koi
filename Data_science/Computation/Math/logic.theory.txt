Symbols:
  - also named signs
  - placeholder for semantics, without semantics of its own

Alphabet:
  - also named vocabulary
  - list of available unique symbols

String of symbols:
  - 0-n symbols, position-significant, possibly duplicate

Syntax:
  - symbols and rules to combine them, regardless of their semantics

Formal language:
  - set of symbols + formal grammar

Formal grammar:
  - set of formation rules

Formation rule:
  - rule asserting which string of symbols are synctactically valid

Production rule:
  - formation rule asserting that a string of symbols is equivalent to another
  - usually left side is shorter, i.e. meant to be substituted by right side
  - empty strings of symbols:
     - allowed, i.e. representing non-significant symbols
     - noted ϵ or λ
  - non-terminal symbol:
     - named also synctactic variable
     - symbol which can always be on the left side of at least one production rule, regardless of symbols before|after
     - opposite: terminal symbols

Context-free grammar:
  - formal grammar using only production rules where left side is single non-terminal symbol

Formula:
  - also named well-formed formula (WFF) or expression
  - string of symbols that are syntactically valid
  - opposite is nonsense

Semantics:
  - meaning assigned to non-logical symbols

Interpretation:
  - assigning semantics to non-logical symbols
  - can be partial:
     - e.g. assigning free variables
     - but must at least define a domain of discourse

Sentence:
  - also named closed formula
  - formula true|false under a given interpretation
  - requires no free variables
  - example: ∃ x,y. x > y

Open formula:
  - opposite of sentence
  - formula neither true|false under a given interpretation
  - has at least one free variable
  - example: x > y

Statement:
  - formula true under a given interpretation

Satisfiability:
  - when formula true under at least one interpretation
  - opposite: unsastisfiability

Semantic validity:
  - also named tautology
  - when formula true under any intepretation
  - opposite: invalidity or contradiction

Logical symbols:
  - logical symbol:
     - also named logical constant or syncategorematic
     - semantics depend on formal language
     - same for any interpretation
     - examples:
        - true|false
        - logical operators, quantifiers
        - programming language keyword
        - punctuation
  - non-logical symbol:
     - also named categorematic or descriptive
     - semantics depend on domain of discourse
     - differ per interpretation
     - can be:
        - object
        - object property, e.g. relation|function|predicate
     - examples:
        - 3, e
        - relations|functions|predicates on domain of discourse
        - programming language value

Domain of discourse:
  - set of all possible semantics of any non-logical symbol for a given formal language
  - example: real numbers

Variability:
  - can be:
     - variable: many possible semantics
     - constant: only one semantic
  - variable|constant is logical or non-logical depending on the semantic it holds
     - examples:
        - logical constant: true
        - logical variable: x (boolean)
        - non-logical constant: 3
        - non-logical variable: x (number)
  - relations|functions|predicates are often constant, but can be variable too (e.g. in high-order functions)
  - bound variable with only one semantic left becomes constant
     - i.e. assigning specific value

Bound variable:
  - also named captured variables
  - variable interpreted with constraints
     - i.e. reduced number of possible semantics
  - free variable:
     - opposite
     - variable interpreted but without constraints
     - i.e. semantic can be any
        - if non-logical: from domain of discourse
  - variable-binding operator:
     - binds a variable in a formula
     - e.g. ∑ or quantifiers

Formal system:
  - formal language + deductive system

Deductive system:
  - set if inference rules

Inference rule:
  - rule connecting statements

Premise:
  - also named hypothesis
  - statement used to infer other statements

Axiom:
  - tautological premise

Theorem:
  - statement infered from a premise

Soundness of a formal system:
  - when every syntactically valid formula is semantically valid

Quantifier:
  - operator asserting truth of a formula for a collection of variables
  - variable-binding operator since it asserts possible semantics of variables
  - universal quantifier:
     - noted ∀ VAR[,...]. FORMULA
     - means FORMULA is true for all combinations of VAR,...
  - existential quantifier:
     - noted ∃ VAR[,...]. FORMULA
     - means FORMULA is true for at least one combination of VAR,...

Logical operators:
  - also named sentential|logical operators|connective
  - operator whose domain|codomain are logical symbols

Boolean domain:
  - notation:
     - B
     - {⊤,⊥}
     - {0,1}
     - {true,false}
  - set with two elements representing true and false

Boolean function:
  - also named switching function
  - when domain and codomain are boolean

Not:
  - notation:
     - !x
     - ~x
  - f(x) = y, where y is true|false if x is false|true

And:
  - notation:
     - x ∧ y
     - x & y
     - x && y
  - f(x,y) = z, where z is true if both x and y are true, false otherwise

Or:
  - notation:
     - x ∨ y
     - x | y
     - x || y
  - f(x,y) = z, where z is false is both x and y are false, true otherwise
