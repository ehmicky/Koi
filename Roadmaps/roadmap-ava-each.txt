AVA-EACH([OPTS, ]ARR|NUM[()],..., FUNC('PREFIX', VAL,...)):
  - must call AVA('PREFIX TITLE', FUNC2) then
  - FUNC() called on each iteration:
     - if several ARR|NUM, does cartesian product
  - reasons:
     - friendly to eslint-plugin-ava
     - independent from AVA:
        - no monkey-patching
        - can call AVA.serial|parallel()
        - can call AVA.skip|only()
     - works with AVA.before|afterEach(), TEST.plan(), timeout, parallelism

On test failure, append iterated data (each()) or index (times()) to error
  - try to use same way of printing/serializing error as Ava source code
  - should work with all reporters

OPTS.bail BOOL: if true (def), only reports first error or whole success
