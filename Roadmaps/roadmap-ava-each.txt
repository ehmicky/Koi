TEST-EACH([OPTS, ]ARR|NUM[()],..., FUNC('PREFIX', VAL,...)):
  - must define tests then
  - FUNC() called on each iteration:
     - if several ARR|NUM, does cartesian product

Goals:
  - simple
  - test runner independent
  - friendly to eslint-plugin-ava

On test failure, append iterated data (each()) or index (times()) to error
  - try to use same way of printing/serializing error as Ava source code
  - should work with all reporters

OPTS.bail BOOL: if true (def), only reports first error or whole success
