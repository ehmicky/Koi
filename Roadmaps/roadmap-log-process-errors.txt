Allow opts.level to be a STR instead of a FUNC
  - test it

opts.level -> opts.level.default|uncaughtException|...

Default level for multipleResolves: "info"

Readme:
  - some anchors are wrong
  - opts.colors: do not mention the case where the output does not support colors
  - no need to write and error.code|detail but can keep link to warning error doc
  - no "..." in usage CLI
  - do not show default option values the first time mentioned since it is mentioned elsewhere below
  - rework event information chapter

Description:
  Show some ❤  to process errors in Node.js

  Node.js emits errors on `uncaughtException`, `warning` and mishandled promises (`unhandledRejection`, `rejectionHandled` and `multipleResolves`).

  Unfortunately by default those errors:
    - do not print stack traces nor promise values for `warning`, `rejectionHandled` and `multipleResolves`
    - are inconvenient to log to an external service
    - are printed repeatedly when the same error occurs several times (except for `warning`)
    - are not human-friendly

  `log-process-errors` fixes those issues:

logo:
  - same font as unix-permissions
  - checksym log
    checksym process
    crosssym errors
    two rows green, one row red. one column bright, one dark
