Signal events:
  - event.name "signals"
  - event.signal "SIGNAME"
  - single handler for any signal
  - listening to some events prevents default handler which terminates process
     - i.e. must do same logic as default handler, after logging finished
        - but must only do so if there were no event handlers, i.e. default one would have been used
  - if other handlers are defined and they call process.exit(), this might interrupt logging
  - only ones that can be listened to cross-platform are SIGINT, SIGTERM
     - however can use os.constants.signals to get list of current OS.
  - do not include uninteresting signals like SIGWINCH
  - can never listen to SIGKILL, SIGSTOP
  - opts.exitOn should not allow "signals"
  - default level is "warn"

Child processes:
  - propagate child process to parent process
  - only if child process is Node too
  - maybe use process.send()
     - this requires user to use options.stdio "ipc" though
