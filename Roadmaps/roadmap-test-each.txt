duplication parenthesis should be:
  - after each part (title + titles[index]) instead of all parts (title)
  - performed before cartesian
     - reason: so it can be streamed
  - done on ARRs but not on NUM (repeat) nor FUNCs (generating functions)

Iterable:
  - two main exports in fast-cartesian:
     - array()->ARR
     - iterable()->ITERABLE
        - document how to use with "for of"
        - document that the goal is lower memory usage if lots of combinations
  - use fastCartesian.iterable() in test-each:
     - callback should iterate incrementally (for of)
     - should return iterator

Cleanup/refactoring

Package it for browsers too

Logo
  - maybe second E is reversed and shows arrows, and first E shows inverse arrows, to produce the "repeat" symbol
  - maybe square/futuristic font

Promote on Tuesday

Medium article:
  - only if first promotion (of GitHub repo only) went well
  - go through how to do a data-driven test with also fuzz testing
  - step by step, with `diff` syntax highlighting
  - go through each feature of test-each with vanilla JavaScript, then at the end show that the final code can be written in just few lines with test-each
     - including snapshot testing and fuzz testing
  - use expression "Cartesian testing"
  - add link in README
