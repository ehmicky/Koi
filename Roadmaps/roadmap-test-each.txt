Separate 'test-each' library from 'gulp-execa'

Goals:
  - simple
  - cartesian product
  - works with any iterable
  - test runner independent

Documentation:
  - if several ARR, does cartesian product
  - can use any other iterator instead of ARR, e.g. STR, generators, maps, sets
  - do not document return value, since it should not be needed in tests

Separate 'fast-cartesian' library from 'test-each'
