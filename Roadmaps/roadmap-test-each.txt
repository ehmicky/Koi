TEST-EACH(VAL[()]_ARR,..., FUNC('SUFFIX', VAL,...))->OBJ:
  - must define tests then
  - FUNC() called on each iteration:
     - if several ARR, does cartesian product
  - 'SUFFIX' should use util.inspect() but tweak options (e.g. should be on single line)
     - should be "(VAL...)":
        - VAL is space separated
        - no quoting on STR
     - if OBJ and OBJ.suffix defined, use it instead
  - return OBJ:
     - args ARR_ARR: each iteration args
     - results ARR: each iteration return value
        - can be used with Promise.all() to await all async functions (if async)
     - not documented since should not be needed in tests

Separate cartesian product library (unless one already exists)
  - make it imperative, for speed

Goals:
  - simple
  - cartesian product
  - test runner independent

Directly do it as part of gulp-execa
