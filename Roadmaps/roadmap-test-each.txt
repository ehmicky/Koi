Separate 'test-each' library from 'gulp-execa'

Goals:
  - simple
  - cartesian product
  - fuzz testing
  - test runner independent
  - works with any iterable

Documentation:
  - if several ARR, does cartesian product
  - can use any other iterator instead of ARR, e.g. generators, STR, maps, sets
  - do not document return value, since it should not be needed in tests
  - NUM and FUNC can be used for fuzz testing
     - mention faker and json-schema-faker
  - FUNC not meant to be triggered should be wrapped in an OBJ
  - args are passed by reference. If mutated, should return them through a FUNC instead, so they are deep cloned.
  - can use closures for stateful FUNCs like exponential counters
  - how to do strided iteration:
     - e.g. iterate on input + return value with an ARR of { input, returnValue }

Separate 'fast-cartesian' library from 'test-each'
