Add more anchors/links in README

Unix-permissions use of test-each:
  Split tests:
    - one test for programmatic
        - command is function imported from source
        - test should just do:
            const output = command(...args)
            t.snapshot(output)
        - only helper needed is handleError() to wrap command (in top level scope)
    - one test for CLI
        - command is string
        - call helper with ("command", ...args)
        - call t.snapshot() in test not helper
        - use DATA_ARR.filter() instead of "if" to exclude invalid CLI args
  Probably remove test/examples.js
