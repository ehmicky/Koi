TEST-EACH([OPTS, ]ARR|NUM[()],..., FUNC('PREFIX', VAL,...)):
  - must define tests then
  - FUNC() called on each iteration:
     - if several ARR|NUM, does cartesian product
  - 'PREFIX' should use util.inspect() but tweak OPTS (e.g. should be on single line)
     - if OBJ and OBJ.testName defined, use it instead

Separate cartesian product library (unless one already exists)
  - make it imperative, for speed

Goals:
  - simple
  - cartesian product
  - test runner independent
  - friendly to eslint-plugin-ava

On error, only print first error???
