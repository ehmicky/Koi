New partial vs full:
  - idempotence tests:
     - positive() + positive()
     - normalize() + normalize() === normalize()
     - set() + set(not())
     - equal() self
     - if equal(), then normalize() === normalize()
     - contain() self
     - if equal(), then contain()
     - deselect() + select()
     - convert() + convert() back === normalize(), except from symbolic|object to number|stat|octal or octal to number|stat

Allow `all` as `object` category during parsing
  - it has lower priority

Todo:
  - using stat that starts with - with CLI fails because yargs think it's an option
  - yargs parse '+1' as 1, i.e. loses operator, unless prepending a space
  - symbolic notation:
     - like "a+o", i.e. "o" means "permissions of o" (this is supported by Unix chmod)
     - X should be noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
     - operator '=' should ignore setuid and setgid on directories
     - setgid is unset if current gid does not match
  - path type, i.e. uses same permission as this path???
     - chmod has an option for this
     - problem: async
