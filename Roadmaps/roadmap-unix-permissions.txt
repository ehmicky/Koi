can read|write|access|create
  - need to add can delete (or can be implied by canWrite()???)

permission setting

Behavior:
  - `symbolic` can use `ugo` as a permission character:
     - e.g. `u+g` means "add all permissions from `group`"
     - only a single character, e.g. `u+gg`, `u+go` and `u+gw` are invalid
  - setuid
  - setgid:
     - if directory:
        - new subdirectories:
           - have setgid set
           - are owned by parent directory's owning group
  - sticky:
     - if directory:
        - all direct child files (any file type) are deletable only by file's owner or directory's owner or privileged user

Parent dir must be writable to remove files???


node.add "user|group|others"[_ARR]:
  - set():
     - take from first argument
     - if several CAT, takes max
  - contains(), equal(), positive(): keep as is
  - not(), min|max(): undefined
  - serialize[Category]():
     - object: as is
     - symbolic:
        - how to prevent serializing to things like a+gu which is not valid with chmod??? does not allow it with symbolic parsing except for X???
        - only serialize to X with execute permission
     - others: same as undefined
  - parse[Category]():
     - object: as is
     - symbolic:
        - permission "u|g|o" -> add: "user|group|others" for each permission (including special permissions??? check chmod behavior, including dir vs non-dir)
        - "X" -> add: "user group others", permission: "execute"
        - a+u,a+r, a+u,a-r or a+u,a+g: check chmod behavior, and accordingly allow mixing them in same part (unlike chmod) and normalize so that there is only one node per category + permission
     - object and symbolic:
        - duplicates are removed
        - empty array -> false
     - others: not used

Todo:
  - symbolic notation:
     - like "a+o", i.e. "o" means "permissions of o" (this is supported by Unix chmod)
     - X should be noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
     - operator '=' should ignore setuid and setgid on directories
     - setgid is unset if current gid does not match
