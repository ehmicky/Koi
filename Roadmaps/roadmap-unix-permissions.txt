CLI input:
  - allow objects and numbers in CLI output:
     - fix tests
     - document
  - using stat|symbolic|octal??? that starts with - with CLI fails because yargs think it's an option
     - normalize -1 does not work???

Todo:
  - symbolic notation:
     - like "a+o", i.e. "o" means "permissions of o" (this is supported by Unix chmod)
     - X should be noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
     - operator '=' should ignore setuid and setgid on directories
     - setgid is unset if current gid does not match
