Fix npm test

README:
  - vertically align examples comments in README.
  - in introduction, skip the "convert" goal and go straight to "use this to use any shape with these commands in Node.js or in command line".

Allow `all` as `object` category during parsing
  - it has lower priority

CLI input:
  - using stat that starts with - with CLI fails because yargs think it's an option
  - yargs parse '+1' as 1, i.e. loses operator, unless prepending a space
  - allow objects, if starts with { and does not throw any exception.
  - allow numbers. Is octal only if ^0\d+$

Todo:
  - symbolic notation:
     - like "a+o", i.e. "o" means "permissions of o" (this is supported by Unix chmod)
     - X should be noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
     - operator '=' should ignore setuid and setgid on directories
     - setgid is unset if current gid does not match
