New partial vs full:
  - change:
     - serialize[Category]:
        - to stat: undefined -> false
        - to octal:
           - undefined -> false unless has at least one undefined and only true|false otherwise (OPERATOR +|-)
           - default OPERATOR is now = (i.e. never serialized)
  - add:
     - not():
        - if partial (some nodes are add:undefined), unset special permissions
        - otherwise if full, invert special permissions
  - remove:
     - full()
        - also update positive() documentation
     - unset()
        - document set(not()) instead
     - invert(), flip()

Allow `all` as `object` category during parsing
  - it has lower priority

Todo:
  - symbolic notation:
     - like "a+o", i.e. "o" means "permissions of o" (this is supported by Unix chmod)
     - X should be noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
     - operator '=' should ignore setuid and setgid on directories
     - setgid is unset if current gid does not match
  - path type, i.e. uses same permission as this path???
     - chmod has an option for this
     - problem: async
  - using stat that starts with - with CLI fails because yargs think it's an option
  - yargs parse '+1' as 1, i.e. loses operator, unless prepending a space
