Todo:
  - `object` special flags should be in OBJ.special.setuid|setgid|sticky instead of OBJ.read|write|execute.*
  - `select|deselect` for special flags:
     - `object`: { read|write|execute|setuid|setgid|sticky BOOL }
     - `octal|number`: extra digit for all special flags
     - `stat`: `rwxszt`
     - `symbolic`: `+rwxszt`
  - `symbolic` can use `ugo` as a permission character:
     - e.g. `u+g` means "add all permissions from `group`"
        - excluding special permissions
     - only a single character, e.g. `u+gg`, `u+go` and `u+gw` are invalid
     - if several comma-separated group, does each in order (including `o+u,o+g` or `o+u,o-r`)
  - `chmod` has particular behavior for `setuid` and `setgid` on directories:
     - `octal` can only set them, but not unset them
     - `symbolic` with `=` does not modify them
  - any `chmod` unsets `setgid` if current `gid` does not match file's owning group
  - `+X` is noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
