Add to all my projects (like ones in unix-permissions):
  - playgrounds
  - examples directory
     - should link to it in `README.md` and `API.md`
  - screenshots/screencasts

Examples should use lowest Node.js version
  - i.e. no need to build

Add examples/README.md:
  - tell how to execute
      - use "bash" not shabang in instruction so it works on Windows

Should publish examples folder

Any programming language:
  - execution: shabang
  - IPC: standard streams

Has own binary:
  - use that in my own tests, i.e. not Ava specific although might rely on Ava

PWD is unchanged and there are no options to change it. User should instead change PWD beforehand.

Reads stdout and when a line is only printing "ready", kill the process:
  - reason: long-running examples like servers
  - normalize "ready" to lowercase and remove anything but letters

Should not fail if snapshot differs only by line order
  - reason: it might be unpredictable

Better way for main require()?
  - `require('unix-permissions') in JavaScript
  - `unix-permissions` in CLI
  - so that it works not just with my own build tasks but also others

Constraint: stdout/stderr must be predictable
  - option to listen only to stdout?
  - what about unpredictable output like PID or current time?
     - option to remove lines or parts of lines before matching?
         - using regexp? line-wise?

autoserver examples: only require index.js?
  - recurse on examples directory or not?

Specifying interpreter arguments?
  - use shabang?

Universal JavaScript?

What if output is different under specific Node js version, e.g. Node 8 has no multipleResolves?

Timeout?

Passing input to stdin?

Handle when:
  - file is not meant to be executed (no permission, or no shabang)
  - interpreter command is missing

Abstract into own package `test-examples`. Potential catchphrase `example-driven testing`

Unix-permissions:
  - add convert.cmd
  - document other commands
