unix-permissions:
  - README.md:
     - put "either" on first bullet point instead
     - "examples directory's files" -> "examples files"
     - link to "examples/README.md" instead
  - examples/README.md:
     - "contains examples of this library"
     - link each method to its full documentation
  - repl.it:
     - "Make sure ... is not commented out." instead
  - types.md + API.md
     - "You can try each example": "You can try all the examples below"
  - API.md:
     - "All the following methods" -> "The following methods"
  - everywhere:
     - wrap each unix-permissions statement (except synopsis examples) with console.log()
     - in full examples remove intermediary "const resultA ="

Documentation of log-process-errors:
  - README.md + CONTRIBUTING.md + bug template:
     - "submit a correction" -> "suggest a correction"
  - CONTRIBUTING.md + bug template:
     - "on the page" -> "on the relevant page"
  - CONTRIBUTING.md:
     - "This document will help you" -> "These guidelines will help you"
     - "you can skip this" -> "please skip this document"
     - move the CI paragraph to beginning of the section
     - "Documentation must be added for any new feature in all of these" -> "New options, methods, properties, configuration and behavior must be documented in all of these"
     - After documentation list: "Please use the same style as the rest of the documentation and examples."
  - bug template:
     - remove 1) of step-by-step instructions
  - PR template:
     - "Please make sure the title is clear and descriptive.
       Then, unless you are fixing a typo or documentation, please fill in the sections below."
     - descriptive title should be second sentence as it is valid for typo fixes too
  - all templates:
     - link to CONTRIBUTING.md is wrong

All my projects: "folder" -> "directory"

gulp-shared-tasks:
  - "This is triggered by husky before any git push." -> "This is automatically triggered before any git push."

require() in full examples:
  - require = require('./utils')
  - directly do: const { convert } = require('unix-permissions')
  - use same comment as one in Unix instead
  - utils.js exports: function(module, ...args) {
       const moduleA = module === 'unix-permissions' ? '../build/src/index' : module
       return require(moduleA)
    }

Add Bash examples to repl.it

Add examples to log-process-errors
  - also use same style for linking to API.md and describing examples in README.md

Unix-permissions:
  - add convert.cmd
  - document other commands

Add to all my projects (like ones in unix-permissions):
  - repl.it
  - examples directory
     - should publish it
  - links to both of them
  - screenshots/screencasts

Examples should use lowest Node.js version
  - i.e. no need to build

Roadmap of test-examples
