When nyc 15 released:
  - use --nycrc-path (https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/1073)
  - check if can remove `spawn-wrap` hack in log-process-errors
  - try to remove `caching-transform` dependency in gulp-shared-tasks
     - this should fix `npm audit` not working

execa:
  - https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa/issues/322
     - fix CI tests for autoserver
  - more refactoring splitting into smaller functions
  - break into several files

On Tuesday, promote gulp-execa

TypeScript:
  - see to_learn.txt for to-do list
  - add:
     - *.js -> *.ts
     - type every function
     - jsdoc on entry points
        - not ones implied by TypeScript types
  - try to use it for input/options validation (check if library exists)
     - check my json-schema roadmap
     - might require separate build step
     - should be a function wrapper
     - checks both input and output
        - this should be skipped when detect that consumer uses tsc too
        - goals:
           - runtime check
           - test that types match implementation, during automated tests
     - apply default values
  - other option for validation:
     - TypeScript to JSON-SCHEMA:
     - also repo for better ajv error messages
     - validation tool:
        - compile-time transform to ajv optimized function
        - @VALIDATE(FILE)(FUNC)
           - using ajv FILE
        - cached (unless ajv cache is enough)
  - try to use it for CLI handling (check if library exists)
     - check my better-cli roadmap

Finish Stripe (see Stripe doc)

"Cross-platform Node.js" Medium series
  - once every Wednesday, based on a chapter of cross-platform-node-guide

  - maybe promote on awesome-cross-platform-nodejs

Check spectrum chat vs Gitter

Fix `timeout` and `killSignal` in Node core (https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/27639)

Go through "versioning" documentation
  - add better changelog logic
     - should include contributors names and thank them

Separate gulp-watch code into own repository
  - re-use Gulp logo but dark and eye symbol instead of "Gulp" word

Separate the codecov upload logic into own repository

codecov-check (see roadmap)

Separate the npm publish logic into own repository

Add tests
  - test on several Gulp versions?
