Add tests
  - test on several Gulp versions?

Separate gulp-node-latest

Separate gulp-watch code into own repository
  - use jest-validate
  - document that gulp.series() should be used instead of `&&` or `;`
  - re-use Gulp logo but dark and eye symbol instead of "Gulp" word

Separate gulp-execa code into own repository
  - if execa PRs get rejected, create a cross-exec repo:
     - for anything in gulp-execa not gulp-specific, i.e.:
        - single string input
        - better error message
     - i.e. wrapper around "execa"
     - promote in Portable Node.js guide
  - use jest-validate
  - "Cross-platform shell commands in Gulp.js"
     - Focus on that the cross-platform since it's the only one being cross-platform
  - warn in README that gulpExeca.stream() should be avoided when command can take several files as input (through globbing, variadic args or dir recursion)
  - document:
      - can only command and args
          - should do several calls instead of ; or &&
          - or gulp.series|parallel()
          - should use opts.std*|input instead of shell pipes and redirections
      - everything escaped, i.e. should not quote nor escape
           - this allows preventing subcommands injections like $(...) as argument
           - no globbing. Alternatives (in preference):
               - callee not caller interpret globbing
               - callee allow directory recursion
               - callee allow multiple files, i.e. caller can perform globbing with tools like minimatch
               - gulpExeca.stream()
           - variable expansion
               - should instead use template string
                   - including process.env
     - should pass envvars with opts.env
     - should use Node.js commands instead of Unix coreutils or Bash commands
     - should use path.normalize()
     - link to Portable Node guide
  - re-use Gulp logo but dark and shell symbol instead of "Gulp" word
  - promote with issue on `execa` repo to add a link
