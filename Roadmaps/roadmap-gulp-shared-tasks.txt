When nyc 15 released:
  - use --nycrc-path (https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/1073)
  - check if can remove `spawn-wrap` hack in log-process-errors
  - try to remove `caching-transform` dependency in gulp-shared-tasks

execa v2:
  - after #271 (stream errors) merged, refactor code:
     - `_getStream` -> `getStream` and `getStream` -> `getStreamPromise`
     - `return ret` -> directly return promises
     - `process[stream]` -> pass process.stdout|stderr|all directly in caller
     - put the beginning of `finalize()` (getStreamPromise() + try/catch) into separate function `getPromiseResult()`
     - extract `finalize()` method to upper scope
  - `kill()`:
     - wait for https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa/pull/280 to be merged
     - merge both options to single `forceKillAfterTimeout` `number | boolean`
     - update CHANGELOG and article with all `kill()`-related commits (#208, #273, #272)
  - new catchphrase of execa
     - should then change description of gulp-execa (package.json, README, GitHub, Gitter, repl.it)
  - release notes
  - Medium post
  - Tweet/contact each contributor
  - promote gulp-execa:
     - create own Medium article
        - link to it in README (like log-process-errors does)

TypeScript:
  - try to use it for input/options validation (check if library exists)
     - check my json-schema roadmap
     - might require separate build step
     - should be a function wrapper
     - checks both input and output
        - this should be skipped when detect that consumer uses tsc too
        - goals:
           - runtime check
           - test that types match implementation, during automated tests
     - apply default values
  - try to use it for CLI handling (check if library exists)
     - check my better-cli roadmap

Finish Stripe (see Stripe doc)

"Cross-platform Node.js" Medium series
  - once every Wednesday, based on a chapter of cross-platform-node-guide
  - promote on cross-platform-node-guide
  - maybe promote on awesome-cross-platform-nodejs

Check spectrum chat vs Gitter

Fix `timeout` and `killSignal` in Node core (https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/27639)

Go through "versioning" documentation
  - add better changelog logic
     - should include contributors names and thank them

Separate gulp-watch code into own repository
  - re-use Gulp logo but dark and eye symbol instead of "Gulp" word

Separate the codecov upload logic into own repository

codecov-check (see roadmap)

Separate the npm publish logic into own repository

Add tests
  - test on several Gulp versions?
