Pretty:
  Do not compute *Pretty (including statsPretty) in advance. Instead, put the pretty logic in a report utils library, and use it in reporters
    - also iteration name, or make it an array instead (without color and padding)???
    - also for statsPretty
       - try to reduce() on stat types, instead of using map-obj repeatedly???
       - padding should be done before colors
       - cleanup `0` and `undefined` so that reporters have cleaner data???
  Add more reporting utilities
  Add theme

`migrate` command should print a message on success

OPTS.info|context -> OPTS.show STR_ARR among 'system', 'metadata'
  - 'system' shows machine|opts|run, 'metadata' shows git|ci|id|timestamp
     - regardless of whether in sharedSystem or not
     - if OPTS.show empty ARR, benchmark.systems|sharedSystem passed to reporters is `undefined`
  - default value:
      - has "system" if OPTS.system defined
      - has "metadata" if show|remove command

Reporting on `remove` command:
  - call reporters, like `show`
  - then prompt for removal confirmation
     - unless OPTS.force true
  - then prompt confirmation removal suceeded

OPTS.quiet true:
  - for all commands
  - no console.log()
     - no success message on `remove|migrate`
     - no logs on `debug` command
     - exception: errors are still printed
  - OPTS.progress|report forces to empty ARR
  - remove OPTS.report "silent"

Error handling:
  - Better way for all plugins (report, progress, stores, runners) to signal user error vs bugs
  - Better handling of child process errors due to runner bugs (handled as user error right now)
  - plugin|core errors should print message to report GitHub issues to the plugin|core
     - it should include system information

OPTS.report|run|store|progress:
  - OPTS.report|run|store|progress 'NAME'_ARR (enable|disable)
  - OPTS.report|run|store|progress_NAME OBJ (options)
     - can set options even if disabled. Does not enable
  - NAME:
     - validated to [a-z][a-z0-9]*
        - no _ . -
     - force module name to spyd-reporter-NAME
        - @scope???

Valid ID: only allow _ not - .
  - reasons:
     - dot is used in CLI flags for nested properties
     - many programming languages like JavaScript are friendlier to _ in identifier
     - camelCasing would require modifying the first letter of id. Keeping id invariant is clearer
     - avoid mix delimiters - and _ in OPTS.system_{systemId}
     - _ is more common in config files
  - minus: CLI flags start with -- but mix _ afterwards
     - could consider replacing any - with _ during CLI parsing, but avoid for the moment
  - in: taskId, inputId, systemId, runnerId, storeId, reporterId
  - do not allow empty strings either (after removing OPTS.merge "" behavior)
  - OPTS.merge:
     - same but allow - (for default UUIDv4)
     - for default value in CI, slugify repository slug to remove any non-confirming character

Named exports in benchmark files:
  - instead of exporting `tasks` array of objects, export each object individually
     - for `cli` runner, means top-level property of YAML whole file, which is a plain object
  - export name is the default value for `task.id`, which can be overridden
  - some known properties (`inputs` and `shell`) are also exported. Users can still use those words as task `id` by specifying them as `task.id` explicitely
  - both in `node` and `cli` runners

Shortcut notation in benchmark files:
  - instead of a plain object, if only property is `main`, can use:
     - `node` runner: function
     - `cli` runner: string

OPTS.run-cli.shell:
  - instead of benchmarkFile.shell
  - STR instead of BOOL: "none", "sh", "bash"
  - should default to "none" instead
  - `cli` runner systems:
     - if "none": none
     - if "bash": id "shell", title "Shell", value "bash_X_Y_Z", description "Bash X.Y.Z"
     - if "sh": id "shell", title "Shell", value "sh_X_Y_Z", description "sh X.Y.Z"

Variables:
  - in `cli` runner:
     - remove user-defined `variables`. Can use either subshells, or command wrapper instead
     - `ignore` command stdout unless a variable is being used, or in debug mode
     - add {{main}} variable (like {{before}})
  - use same logic for both OPTS.system and `cli` runner
  - variable case:
     - ENV_VAR: use process.env as is, i.e. case sensitive on Unix, case insensitive on Windows
     - others:
        - case sensitive
        - lowercase (unless user-defined)
  - available variables (in lowest priority order):
     - OPTS.system:
        - {{ENV_VAR}}
        - {{os}} {{os_full}}
        - runner-specific variable, e.g. {{node_major_version}}
     - `cli` runner:
        - {{ENV_VAR}}
        - {{before}}, {{main}}
        - {{inputId}}
  - enforce [a-z][a-z0-9_]* for runner-specific system variables

Use a `config` library instead of using our own logic

Learn package 'simple-statistics' and use it in spyd

Use git provider assets in CI for spyd-store-*:
  - e.g. GitHub action download|upload-artifact
     - or Travis download artifacts

Separate into different repos:
  - some plugins are builtin, i.e. required as production dependencies by core
     - including spyd-run-node and spyd-run-cli (until more runners are created)
  - types:
     - spyd-report-*
     - spyd-run-*
     - spyd-store-*
     - spyd-progress-*
  - spyd -> spyd (CLI) + spyd-core (non-CLI)

Add progress reporters:
  - spinner with task name and current median
  - progress bar
  - both above (def)

Reporters:
  - types:
     - JSON
     - CLI list
     - CLI table
     - Markdown list
     - Markdown table
     - CLI graphs|histograms
     - CLI where the tasks are in both axis, and the cells are the difference in %
     - CLI with horizontal bars for medians
        - with full CLI width for slowest median
        - still show numbers on top of bars (or on their left side)
        - def reporter instead of simple CLI list, except when there is only one iteration
        - for Markdown too???
     - HTML
     - CLI time series (with previous iterations)
  - CLI|Markdown list:
     - follow the formatting I used in fast-cartesian example
        - simple list for TASK with no inputs
  - CLI|Markdown tables:
     - inputs as x axis, tasks as y axis
  - default reporter:
     - CLI|Markdown table if more than half of cells would be filled, and some TASK.inputs are defined
        - CLI|Markdown list otherwise
     - Markdown table|list if OPTS.insert '*.md|*.markdown|README|readme'
        - CLI table|list otherwise
  - when BENCHMARK.histogram|percentiles [], reporters should show "Not enough data" (but not throw)
  - Markdown|HTML reporters should add "Benchmarked with [spyd](https://github.com/ehmicky/spyd)" when REPORTER_OPTS.link true
     - but CLI reporters should never add anything (except 'debug' reporter)

When killing child process, should kill descendants too
  - e.g. with spyd-runner-cli and command 'yes', 'yes' keeps running after timeout

Competitors benchmark:
  - benchmark with other benchmarking tools
  - each should benchmark Math.random() for the same duration
     - use different durations as inputs
  - report both medians (for accuracy) and standard deviation (for precision)

Add tests, documentation, etc.:
  - for all repos, including sub-repos

Consider lowering the valid Node version for spyd-runner-node, so that `run.node.versions` can target lower versions

Consider using a key-value abstraction layer to add more built-in spyd-store-*

Utilities to help people creating reporters, runners, progress reporters, stores
  - GitHub template
  - test utility

Add other runners:
  - spyd-run-chrome (maybe using puppetter)
  - spyd-run-firefox (maybe using puppetter-firefox)
  - spyd-run-selenium
  - spyd-run-bash

Add roadmap:
  - point to it from contribution doc to orient contributors towards features I want (e.g. HTML reporter)

Promote:
  - add keywords (GitHub, package.json)

Features:
  - most precise and accurate benchmarking
  - pretty reporting
  - comparison with previous benchmarks
  - performance testing
  - automatically insert latest benchmarks into your documentation
  - custom reporters
  - TypeScript support
  - CI-friendly

Commercial offer:
  - reporting dashboard:
     - show time series (i.e. keep history)
        - should not lose history when change only the `title` of the function|variant
     - nice data visualization
     - should show function bodies
  - code editor for benchmark files:
     - run benchmarks (inside browser not on our servers)
     - send benchmark results to API (like what users would do on CI otherwise)
     - show results from API
     - i.e. can be used like jsperf
  - Sharing like jsperf:
     - allow users to run in their own browsers
  - PR bot
  - notifications
  - user should report benchmark results to our API
     - like Codecov does
     - i.e. we do not pay for infrastructure cost, except simple CRUD API to store benchmark results
     - should be integrated with CI (i.e. use `ci-info`)
  - pricing:
     - free for open source
     - pay per private repo
