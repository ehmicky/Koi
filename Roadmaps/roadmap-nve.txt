tweet thread about NUM reasons I like/dislike Node.js release process

280 chars
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

10 reasons I love Node.js release process:
  1) proper semantic versioning
  2) the schedule is publicly communicated
  3) the schedule is strictly followed. However it is flexible to real-life input. For example Node 8 support ends in December due to the end of support for SSL 1.0.2.
  - frequent backports
  - binaries shipped in several compression formats (.xz/.7z and .gz)
  - checksums
  - GPG signatures
  - documentation shows when feature were added
  - thanks to maintenance and LTS, can get security fixes without upgrading to new major versions with breaking changes
  - release information available programmatically

Dislike:
  - odd versions meant to be unstable, but I haven't noticed more unstable. Maybe not needed.
  - changelog could be improved, e.g. with blog posts featuring examples
  - some new features are sometimes not featured in the changelog, must be found in list of commits instead

When nyc 15 released:
  - use --nycrc-path (https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/1073)
  - check if can remove `spawn-wrap` hack in log-process-errors
  - try to remove `caching-transform` dependency in gulp-shared-tasks
     - this should fix `npm audit` not working
  - check all the tests TODO in nve related to issues with nyc

execa:
  - try to fix tests that keep failing on CI

Use the .zip file on Windows
  - with jszip
     - see jszip-utils too
  - only if <4.5.0 || 5.*.* || <6.2.1

Use the .7z file on Windows
  - only if <4.5.0 || 5.*.* || <6.2.1

Verify checksums with GPG signature

Add support for BSD and Android
