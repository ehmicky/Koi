Verify checksums with GPG signature

Add support for BSD, Android, armv6l

'.' alias in nve:
  - https://github.com/ehmicky/get-node/pull/4
  - ask for another PR with engines.node in package.json afterwards. Has less priority than nvmrc, but more if lower directory

Travis -> GitHub actions
  Figure out why following repos tests fail: nve, nvexeca, test-api
  Add some kind of notification
    - replace Travis URLs by GitHub actions ones (see netlify/build for example): does not seem to work anymore???
  For each repo, ensure tests are succeeding
  Remove Travis account
  Remove Travis from .bashrc
    - try to replace upt() by a way to add NPM_TOKEN secret programmatically
