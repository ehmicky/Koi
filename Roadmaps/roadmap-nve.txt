Verify checksums with GPG signature

Add support for BSD, Android, armv6l

preferred-node-version:
  - nvm aliases:
     - part of loading .nvmrc (like package.json has own logic)
        - i.e. only if .nvmrc
        - each file should have own logic
     - not used by normalize-node-version nor available as top aliases in nve
     - all-node-versions:
        - should return LTS list
        - should put its own caching logic there instead of inside normalize-node-version
     - separate project
     - add nvm aliases:
        - lts/*, lts/NAME, lts/-NUM
        - custom aliases and "system": call execa("nvm ...", {shell: true})
        - iojs???
     - add aliases from .naverc and .node-version and any nvm alternatives
  - used by get-node if alias ".":
     - no need for additional normalizeNodeVersion() unless undefined
     - def to "*"
  - add preferred-node-version to the README of all nve projects
  - update issues:
     - https://github.com/ehmicky/get-node/pull/4
     - https://github.com/ehmicky/normalize-node-version/pull/1

uploadCoverage fails randomly
  - example: https://github.com/ehmicky/nvexeca/runs/560883959?check_suite_focus=true
  - bug: https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action/issues/68. Once fixed:
     - fix `shouldCover()` in `dev-tasks`, release to all repos and make sure all uploadCoverage are now passing
     - remove all CODECOV_TOKEN from workflow.yml, and make sure all uploadCoverage are still passing
     - remove all CODECOV_TOKEN from repo settings (GitHub secret)

Figure out why nve tests fail with GitHub actions

get-node should export a way to check if valid alias so nve can use it???

nve src/parse.js might be wrong:
 - when doing --OPT VALUE --OTHEROPT instead of --OPT=VALUE --OTHEROPT, it seems like VALUE would be --OTHEROPT would be skipped?
 - does it work with aliases, e.g. --OPT . .???

Linting:
  - enforce only arrow functions are used, not `function`
     - see https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13141
