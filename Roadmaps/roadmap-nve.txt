Upgrade my projects to Node 13

On new nyc major release, check all the tests TODO related to issues with nyc

OPTS.parallel true (def: false):
  - stream/buffer each process in turn
  - on error, if OPTS.continue false:
     - send SIGTERM to all others on error
     - current command should print "Node VERSION aborted"
     - print the `all` of the child process that failed
  - fix stdin
  - issues with process.stdin|stdout|stderr.isTTY:
     - false in child processes since not using 'inherit'
     - should keep colors by setting ENVVAR FORCE_COLOR using parent process.stdout.getColorDepth()
  - create a package pipeSeries(STREAM_ARR, STREAM)???
     - like Stream.pipeline() but stream each output in order
     - stream first STREAM
     - then when done, write buffer of second STREAM and stream that one, and so on

Use progress bar instead of spinner in fetch-node-website

Use the .zip file for Windows

Try using xz (Unix) and 7zip (Windows) archives:
  - maybe forget streaming and use system binary if available

Split all my project CLIs to separate projects

Submit nve to https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs

Add a link to "Related" in Execa

Learn CLI/Terminal from to_learn

Finish learning GitHub actions

run-github-action:
  - run GitHub action outside GitHub, e.g. locally
  - use cases:
     - re-using in other projects, e.g. netlify/build
     - testing
