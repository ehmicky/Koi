When nyc 15 released:
  - use --nycrc-path (https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/1073)
  - check if can remove `spawn-wrap` hack in log-process-errors
  - try to remove `caching-transform` dependency in gulp-shared-tasks
     - this should fix `npm audit` not working
  - check all the tests TODO in nve related to issues with nyc

execa:
  - try to fix tests that keep failing on CI

npm_config_prefix might be already defined but with a different case

Issue with path-key:
  - on Windows, first ENVVAR has priority
     - when node loads, set lower priority value to high priority
  - child_process.spawn() inverse envvar but not on Windows

  - when PATH + Path are defined (on Windows) (e.g. on Travis CI), child_process.spawn() only respects Path and ignores PATH
     - or actually it seems like it respects the last defined property in the object
  - also execa opts.execPath uses PATH-KEY as well, i.e. patches PATH instead of Path, i.e. not used

Global binaries fix
  - fix Windows tests in CI (see path-key above)
  - add comment to remove COVERAGE=false once nyc issue is fixed
