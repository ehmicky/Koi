some eslint fails: autoserver, test-api, spyd, nve. Try gpp

npm i -g nve (for 2.1.0)

Upgrade all my .travis.yml to use `dist: bionic`

nve (release/v3 branch):
  - figure out why commented test in test/cli.js fails with nyc
  - options parsing:
     - use yargs
     - make sure positional arguments are not altered at all
     - pass as OPTS.* in nve("VERSION", "COMMAND", ["ARG"_ARR][, OPTS])
  - ENVVAR NVE_PROGRESS -> OPTS.progress BOOL
  - OPTS.onCreate(CHILD_PROCESS, "VERSION", INDEX)[->PROMISE]:
     - "VERSION" is input, not normalized
     - CLI should use it to pipe output
     - CLI should return PROMISE awaiting child process stdout|stderr
     - should await all PROMISEs at end, once every CHILD_PROCESS has been created???
        - what if serial run, i.e. PROMISE rejected earlier???
  - return value should be PROMISE resolved with ARR of { code, signal } or rejected with ERROR when whole run is done
  - Allow running multiple Node versions at once:
     - space-separated VERSION
     - versions order: same as input for both execution and output
     - execution is in parallel
        - unless OPTS.serial true (def: false)
     - output:
        - each output printed as is
        - if parallel, first child process output is piped/streamed, next ones are buffered and printed whole
        - if serial, every child process output is piped/streamed
        - if more than one version, each version output is:
           - prepended with a line showing the "Node.js VERSION"
              - VERSION is same as input, not normalized
              - in green unless OPTS.colors false (def: if stdout supports colors)
          - appended with an empty line
     - OPTS.wait BOOL:
        - false (def): stop on first exit code != 0 and use it
        - true:
           - wait for all child processes
  - check if `xz --version` exit code is 0, and if so, download *.tar.xz instead of *.tar.gz
     - except for AIX or if Node <0.12.10
  - clean cache:
     - max cache size 10
     - remove last used first
        - not last created
        - which of atime|mtime|ctime is most reliable and relevant???
     - clean when nve called
  - go through whole nve code again
  - update benchmarks
  - fix documentation and examples
     - include the fact that since this is now a full-fledge alternative to nvm, no need to point to it anymore
  - submit nve to https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs
  - spyd --run.node.versions should use nve somehow (instead of get-node), so that child processes use the right Node.js version
