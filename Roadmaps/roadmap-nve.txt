Upgrade my projects to Node 13

On new nyc major release, check all the tests TODO related to issues with nyc

OPTS.parallel true (def: false):
  - check why CI tests are failing
  - check current code
  - make exit code work
  - do not use two different error handling logic in src/cli/main.js (handleTopError() or no handleTopError())
  - check stdin
  - keep colors by setting ENVVAR FORCE_COLOR using parent process.stdout.getColorDepth()
  - add tests
  - stream stdout|stderr for the first process
  - add documentation
  - create a package pipeSeries(STREAM_ARR, STREAM)???
     - like Stream.pipeline() but stream each output in order
     - stream first STREAM
     - then when done, write buffer of second STREAM and stream that one, and so on

Use progress bar instead of spinner in fetch-node-website

Use the .zip file for Windows

Try using xz (Unix) and 7zip (Windows) archives:
  - maybe forget streaming and use system binary if available

Split all my project CLIs to separate projects

Submit nve to https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs

Add a link to "Related" in Execa

Learn CLI/Terminal from to_learn

Finish learning GitHub actions

run-github-action:
  - run GitHub action outside GitHub, e.g. locally
  - use cases:
     - re-using in other projects, e.g. netlify/build
     - testing
