When nyc 15 released:
  - use --nycrc-path (https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/1073)
  - check if can remove `spawn-wrap` hack in log-process-errors
  - try to remove `caching-transform` dependency in gulp-shared-tasks
     - this should fix `npm audit` not working
  - check all the tests TODO in nve related to issues with nyc

execa:
  - try to fix tests that keep failing on CI

npm_config_prefix might be already defined but with a different case

  - on Windows, first ENVVAR has priority
     - when node loads, set lower priority value to high priority
  - child_process.spawn() inverse envvar but not on Windows

How env works:
  - Linux|Mac:
     - case-sensitive
     - Bash `env` and Node `process.env` are listed in somewhat random order
  - Mac:
     - case-insensitive in cmd.exe
     - case-sensitive in msys, but normalizes differently cased ENVVARs to single value (with different names) when passed to node
        - last defined keys prevails
           - e.g. A=1 a=2 node -> A=2 a=2
           - e.g. spawn(..., {env: {A: 1, a: 2} }) -> A=2 a=2

Issue with path-key:
  - when PATH + Path are defined on Windows on Travis CI, child_process.spawn() only respects Path and ignores PATH
  - also execa opts.execPath uses PATH-KEY as well, i.e. patches PATH instead of Path, i.e. not used
  - issue is that only the last defined property in env is respected:
     - if Path is used in both execa and nvexeca, it fixes the issue

Global binaries fix
  - fix Windows tests in CI (see path-key above)
  - add comment to remove COVERAGE=false once nyc issue is fixed
