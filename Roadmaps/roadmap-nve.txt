On new nyc major release, check all the tests TODO related to issues with nyc

Multiple versions:
  - add tests for:
     - runVersions()
     - bin/parse.js
     - bin/serial.js
  - add examples and documentation for this
  - make minor release
  - OPTS.wait BOOL (def: false):
     - whether to stop execution on Execa error
     - if true, exitCode is the highest exitCode (undefined defaults to 1)
  - OPTS.parallel true (def: false):
     - stream/buffer each process in turn
     - on error, if OPTS.wait false:
        - send SIGTERM to all others on error
        - current command should print "Node VERSION aborted"
        - print the `all` of the child process that failed
     - make sure stdin can still be used from CLI
     - issues with process.stdin|stdout|stderr.isTTY:
        - false in child processes since not using 'inherit'
        - should keep colors by setting ENVVAR FORCE_COLOR using parent process.stdout.getColorDepth()
     - create a package pipeSeries(STREAM_ARR, STREAM):
        - like Stream.pipeline() but stream each output in order
        - stream first STREAM
        - then when done, write buffer of second STREAM and stream that one, and so on
