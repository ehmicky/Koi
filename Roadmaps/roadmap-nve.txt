nve (release/v3 branch):
  - use the .zip file for Windows
  - Allow running multiple Node versions at once:
     - space-separated VERSION
     - versions order: same as input for both execution and output
     - download and normalize versions should happen in parallel, and finish all before any child process starts
     - execution is serial
        - unless OPTS.parallel true (def: false)
     - output:
        - each output printed as is
        - if parallel, first child process output is piped/streamed, next ones are buffered and printed whole
        - if serial, every child process output is piped/streamed
        - if more than one version, each version output is:
           - prepended with a line showing the "Node.js VERSION"
              - VERSION is same as input, not normalized
              - in green unless OPTS.colors false (def: if stdout supports colors)
          - appended with an empty line
  - iterate(versionRange_ARR, command, args, opts)->ITERATOR_PROMISE_OBJ:
     - OBJ:
        - childProcess
        - version 'VERSION' (input, nor normalized)
        - exit PROMISE (must be awaited):
           - code NUM
           - signal STR
     - PROMISE is rejected on ERROR but not if exit code !== 0
  - run(versionRange, command, args, opts)->PROMISE_OBJ:
     - built on top of iterate()
     - opts has extra members stdout|stderr:
        - STREAMs to pipe to
        - def: process.stdout|stderr
        - can be 'ignore'
     - OBJ:
        - code NUM: highest exit code
     - PROMISE is rejected on ERROR but not if exit code !== 0
     - used by CLI
  - OPTS.wait BOOL:
     - false (def):
        - stop on first exit code != 0
        - if serial, stop iteration. If parallel, send SIGTERM to other child processes
        - done at the programmatic level, not CLI
     - true: wait for all child processes
  - go through whole nve code again
  - update benchmarks
  - fix documentation and examples
     - include the fact that since this is now a full-fledge alternative to nvm, no need to point to it anymore
  - submit nve to https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs
  - spyd --run.node.versions should use nve somehow (instead of get-node), so that child processes use the right Node.js version
