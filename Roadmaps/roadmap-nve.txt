Redirect stdin too in CLI

Use execa:
  - allow execa options
      - default preferLocal true
      - check other options???
  - return value is EXECA_CHILD_PROCESS
  - use OPTS.reject true but do not show execa error. Only use exitCode (1 if undefined)

go through whole nve code again

update benchmarks

fix documentation and examples
  - include the fact that since this is now a full-fledge alternative to nvm, no need to point to it anymore

Make major release

spyd --run.node.versions should use nve somehow (instead of get-node), so that child processes use the right Node.js version

Use the .zip file for Windows

Multiple versions:
  - CLI only
  - space-separated VERSION
  - versions order: same as input for both execution and output
  - download and normalize versions should happen in parallel, and finish all before any child process starts
     - how since this is CLI only???
  - OPTS.parallel BOOL (def: false):
     - whether execution is serial
     - serial: use execa OPTS.stdio 'inherit' and OPTS.buffer false
     - parallel:
        - buffer each process until all the previous ones have completed
           - how???
        - then print buffer and start streaming
  - OPTS.wait BOOL (def: false):
     - whether to use execa OPTS.reject true
        - i.e. not only exitCode !== 0 but also termination signals
     - whether to stop execution on error
        - if parallel:
           - print the child process stdout|stderr that failed
           - then send SIGTERM to all others
     - is true, exitCode is the highest exitCode
  - if more than one version, each version output is:
     - prepended with a line showing the "Node.js VERSION"
        - VERSION is same as input, not normalized
        - in green unless OPTS.colors false (def: if stdout supports colors)
     - appended with an empty line
