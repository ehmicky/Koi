test-each:
  - test title should serialize strings as is (but without quotes). Otherwise newlines are printed which leads to multi-line test titles

Upgrade my projects to Node 13

On new nyc major release, check all the tests TODO related to issues with nyc

OPTS.parallel true (def: false):
  - tests randomly fail: try while (( $? == 0 )); do ava; done
  - add the ENOENT feature back (--help printed on ENOENT) (f221db6)
  - add documentation

Use progress bar instead of spinner in fetch-node-website

Use the .zip file for Windows

Try using xz (Unix) and 7zip (Windows) archives:
  - maybe forget streaming and use system binary if available

Split all my project CLIs to separate projects

When using --parallel:
  - stream each output in order:
     - when switching to a new child process, write its buffered output then start streaming
  - child process stderr should be redirect to parent stderr, not stdout
     - at the moment, it's redirected to stdout because stdout+stderr are aggregated by `execa.all`
