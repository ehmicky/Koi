STATSD PROTOCOL ==>               #Protocol for:
                                  #  - client measuring metrics
                                  #  - to send to server aggregated and visualizing those
                                  #Meant to be generic and simple for clients, letting server do heavy tasks
                                  #Transport protocol-agnostic
                                  #  - often UDP is used, and sometimes TCP
                                  #Human readable

MNAME:UINT|TYPE[|@FLOAT][|#TAG,..]#Format of each line (metric message)

MNAME                             #Metric name
@FLOAT                            #Sample rate
                                  #  - e.g. "0.1" if only 1/10 metrics are sent
                                  #Meant to multiply to metrics values
                                  #Not on "g|s" metrics
                                  #Def: 1

TYPE c                            #Cumulative count (adds to last value)
TYPE m                            #Meter. Like "c", but meant to compute occurence rate over time
TYPE g                            #Non-cumulative count (only keeps last value)
                                  #If UINT is prefixed with +|-, relative to last value
TYPE s                            #Counts unique values of a set
                                  #UINT is any STR instead, i.e. adds a possibly duplicate value to existing set
TYPE ms                           #Duration
TYPE h                            #Histogram. Like "ms"

TAG                               #Custom metadata
                                  #Often "KEY:VAL"

FLUSHES ==>                       #Can work with client sending data at regular intervals
                                  #Each time this is done, TYPEs metrics can be reset.

BULK ==>                          #Can send multiple lines at once in a single "packet"
                                  #Must be sure in fits in transport, e.g. within TCP|UDP MTU (512 bytes is reasonable)
