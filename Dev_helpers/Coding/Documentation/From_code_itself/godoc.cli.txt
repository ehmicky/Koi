The index contains both identifier and full text search information (searchable via regular expressions). The maximum number of full text search results shown can be set with the -maxresults flag; if set to 0, no full text results are shown, and only an identifier index but no full text search index is created.
By default, godoc uses the system's GOOS/GOARCH. You can provide the URL parameters "GOOS" and "GOARCH" to set the output on the web page for the target system.

The presentation mode of web pages served by godoc can be controlled with the "m" URL parameter; it accepts a comma-separated list of flag names as value:
  all	show documentation for all declarations, not just the exported ones
  methods	show all embedded methods, not just those of unexported anonymous fields
  src	show the original source code rather than the extracted documentation
  flat	present flat (not indented) directory listings using full paths

For instance, https://golang.org/pkg/math/big/?m=all shows the documentation for all (not just the exported) declarations of package big.

Godoc documentation is converted to HTML or to text using the go/doc package; see https://golang.org/pkg/go/doc/#ToHTML for the exact rules.
Godoc also shows example code that is runnable by the testing package; see https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Examples for the conventions.
See "Godoc: documenting Go code" for how to write good comments for godoc: https://golang.org/doc/articles/godoc_documenting_go_code.html
